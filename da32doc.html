      ## Ring-Ball <br>
      ### Originality: What is original about your game?<br>
      What's original about my game is the exponentially-increasing difficulty. It's a gradual increase in the speed at which the ball falls upon each successful plate encounter.<br>
      ### Technical Merit: What is interesting about your game technology?<br>
      It uses randomness to change the color of the ball the player controls upon passing through the appropriate colored rings. Furthermore, the game itself is made with Unity targeting HTML5, which means anyone can play the game given sufficient hardware.<br>
      ### Prototype Postmortem: What did you learn from this prototype? What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
      What I learned from this prototype is that you should keep source-files for a project separate from a new one, even if reusing old assets. The easiest part was playtesting the game, but the hardest part was writing this documentation.<br>
      ### Prototype Assets: Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.<br>
      I borrowed assets from the Unity URP template pack and reconfigured the materials on the buckets, resized the buckets to the size of a plate, and reused the props in the sample scene to make the game scene.<br>
      ### Prototype Closest Other Game: Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code, you must say so here.<br>
      I'm not too familiar with other games that resemble my game, however, I believe the closest would be something like a fishing-ninja but instead of dodging fishes to go further, you have to encounter plates to go further.<br>
      ### High Concept: A one-sentence summary of your game.<br>
      A ball falling must pass through plates of the same color to continue falling. You lose the drag you feel on each successive plate encounter.<br>
      ### Theme: State which of the themes or challenges you used.<br>
      No themes were used from the optional themes and challenged provided.
      ### Mandated Variety: State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.<br>
      #### Input: Keyboard keys A and D or the Left and Right arrow keys for moving the ball left or right.<br>
      #### Randomness: The color of the ball changes to Blue, Red, White, or Green randomnly upon collision with the matching colored plate.
      #### genre: Classic Arcade (remniscent of Mario-party games)<br>
      #### Play style: progressively increasing challenge with focus on predictablity and reaction-time.<br>
      ### Prototype Goal: What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<br>
      The mechanic being evaluated is non-snapping alignment of the ball the player controls as opposed to snapping control. Giving the player more freedom versus taking away freedom.<br>
      ### Player Experience Goals: What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<br>
      I want players to embrace the concept of randomness and focus on reaction-time to guide the ball to the appropriate plate.<br>
      ### Gameplay: A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.<br>
      The actions that the player can perform are limited to moving the ball left and right. This is done through the use of either the keyboard A and D keys, or the arrow keys.<br>
      The core mechanic of the game is to move the color-changing ball to pass through the colored plates. The player is limited to controlling only the ball.<br>
      ### Strategies: What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<br>
      A possible player strategy would be to pre-move the ball to either direction upon landing on a plate. Chances are, they could be moving in the direction they need to be.<br>
      ### Story/Setting/Premise: A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
      You spawn into a world as a ball. No idea why, but you just did. Now you're falling. You react on instinct and are drawn through a force of gravity that pulls you towards an endless stream of plates with distinct colors. Your own color guides you to go to the plates of matching color. That is all, and now you fall.<br>
      ### Target Audience: A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<br>
      Adults and folks who like arcade-style games that get progressively more difficult.<br>
      Play Time: How long does your game take to play?<br>
      Roughly 10-seconds to however long a player plays and continues to not-lose for.
