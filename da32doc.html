<h1>CS 325 Digital Assignment 3A Game 2 Documentation</h1>

      ## Ring-Ball <br>
      ### Originality: What is original about your game?<br>
      <br>
      ### Technical Merit: What is interesting about your game technology?<br>
      It uses randomness to change the color of the ball the player controls upon passing through the appropriate colored rings. Furthermore, the game itself is made with Unity targeting HTML5, which means anyone can play the game given sufficient hardware.<br>
      ### Prototype Postmortem: What did you learn from this prototype? What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
      What I learned from this prototype is that there's a lot that could go wrong if you choose a platform other than windows to develop on (for unity). The easiest part was sitting down and coding the game, but the hardest part was trying to balance the speed of the balls' movement and the reaction time of moving buckets in the game starting at the time the player sends input through a key-press.<br>
      ### Prototype Assets: Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.<br>
      I borrowed assets from the Unity URP template pack and reconfigured the materials on the buckets and reused the props in the sample scene to make the game scene.<br>
      ### Prototype Closest Other Game: Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code, you must say so here.<br>
      I'm not too familiar with other games that resemble my game, however, I believe the closest would be something like a combination of panda-pop and fruit-ninja in their own ways.<br>
      ### High Concept: A one-sentence summary of your game.<br>
      Balls falling and rolling from platforms must be sorted to the appropriate bins, and you must move the bins to sort as many as you can correctly out of 100 that fall.<br>
      ### Theme: State which of the themes or challenges you used.<br>
    
      ### Mandated Variety: State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.<br>
      #### Input: Keyboard keys A and D for moving the current bucket doing the ball-catching.<br>
      #### Randomness: The positions in which the balls spawn and what color spawns at those spawnpoints.<br>
      #### genre: Classic Arcade (remniscent of Mario-party games)<br>
      #### play style: progressively increasing challenge with an active play-style.<br>
      ### Prototype Goal: What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<br>
      ### The game mechanic that this prototype is evaluating is uncertainty due to simulated physics and randomness (ball colors and their spawnpoints).<br>
      ### Player Experience Goals: What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<br>
      I want players to embrace the concept of randomness and the feeling of being overwhelmed with possible moves to handle various types of situations, ie you were planning on catching a blue ball but then a red one got dropped right infront of it, and the ball to your right is green but it's speeding up and will reach the center before the red, and et.<br>
      ### Gameplay: A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.<br>
      The actions that the player can perform are limited to moving the bins left and right. This is done through the use of either the keyboard A and D keys, or the arrow keys, or through mouse movement.<br>
      The core mechanic of the game is to move the colored bins to catch the falling balls. The player is limited to controlling only the bins and not the spawn-positions of the ball, nor their colors <br>
      ### Strategies: What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<br>
      A possible player strategy would be to fast-shift the bins left and right to keep the balls somewhat bouncing and in place and then adjusting the bins methodically to make the best catches for a given ball accumulation.<br>
      ### Story/Setting/Premise: A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
      You're a construction worker who's working on getting the paint ready for a project. Your buddy is high up on a crane and out of view, and he has all of the paint stored in paint-balls.<br>
      You would be collecting the paint in trips to get the balls in batches, however, your buddy thinks it's a good idea to simply let him toss them down to you and have you just sort them on the fly<br>
      For some reason, you agree to the conditions and now you're here. Happy sorting!
      ### Target Audience: A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<br>
      Adults and folks who like arcade-style games that get progressively more difficult.<br>
      Play Time: How long does your game take to play?<br>
      Roughly 5-10 minutes.
