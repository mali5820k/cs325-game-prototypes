      ## Agent-Smith in: Limbo-madness <br>
      <br>### Originality: What is original about your game?<br>
      What's original about my game is the reality-tv like obstacles that you see people try to overcome, but it's focused on the "hole-in-the-wall" kind of genre but inverted.<br>
      <br>### Technical Merit: What is interesting about your game technology?<br>
      It uses randomness to change the positions, rotations, and shape blocks that move towards Agent-Smith within the game-window. Furthermore, the game itself is made with Unity targeting HTML5, which means anyone can play the game given sufficient hardware.<br>
      <br>### Prototype Postmortem: What did you learn from this prototype? What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
      What I learned from this prototype is that simple concepts chained together can make a really fun game, even though not finished yet, it looks interesting. The easiest part was playtesting the game, but the hardest part was writing this documentation.<br>
      <br>### Prototype Assets: Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.<br>
      I used the Bodyguards asset from the Unity asset store and used one of the three provided models, reconfigured the materials to work with URP and then utilized primitive 3D objects in Unity to construct the game level.<br>
      <br>### Prototype Closest Other Game: Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code, you must say so here.<br>
      The hole-in-the-wall type games are very similar to my game, except it's inverted and you try to get around the wall. I did not borrow code from anywhere, but I did use Unity Documentation and forum posts to utilize component hierarchies with Unity's API. That isn't specific to anyone except the Unity Engine. Nonetheless, the link is here: https://answers.unity.com/questions/1282940/get-all-child-transforms-in-target.html<br>
      <br>### High Concept: A one-sentence summary of your game.<br>
      Agent-Smith got transported to another dimension in stead of the past that he wanted to go to, now you need to stay-alive and live through this mini-obstacle to continue on with the rest of the movie!<br>
      <br>### Theme: State which of the themes or challenges you used.<br>
      The theme of Special Agent and an attempt to utilize the story of the Men-in-Black's protagonist (Will Smith) as a motivator.
      <br>### Mandated Variety: State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.<br>
      <br>#### Input: Keyboard keys WASD, or directional arrow-keys, spacebar, and c keys.<br>
      <br>#### Randomness: The positions, rotations, and shapes of the wall objects that are moving towards Agent-Smith.
      <br>#### genre: Arcade (remniscent of Reality-tv show-like games but mixed with platforming)<br>
      <br>#### Play style: progressively increasing challenge with focus on predictablity and reaction-time.<br>
      <br>### Prototype Goal: What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<br>
      The mechanic being tested is giving the player confined freedom of movement along 2-dimensions as opposed to button-presses for dodging action-sequences.<br>
      <br>### Player Experience Goals: What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<br>
      I want players to experience a movie action-sequence-like game, where they're dictating the actions of the actor in a challenging scenario.<br>
      <br>### Gameplay: A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.<br>
      The actions that the player can perform are limited to moving through the use of the keyboard W, A, S, and D keys, or the arrow keys, and the spacebar and C keys.<br>
      The core mechanic of the game is evasion. You can evade objects by moving left or right, jumping, or even crouching.<br>
      <br>### Strategies: What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<br>
      The strategies that I expect will be effective at playing this game is spacial-reasoning and fast decision-making. Looking for opportune moments to move in between waves of the wall-objects moving towards Agent-Smith, you can jump over obstacles as long as you don't hit them head on, therefore, try to use other obstacles as jump points to jump higher than the walls infront of you.<br>
      <br>### Story/Setting/Premise: A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
      Agent Smith was transported to a dimension different from the one he wanted to be in. In this parallel timeline, you must survive to the end of the wall-challenge that is presented infront of you to get out of this mess. Careful now, there's nothing stopping you from an endless fall aside from the platform you're currently on!<br>
      <br>### Target Audience: A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<br>
      Adults and folks who like progressional games that get progressively more difficult.<br>
      Play Time: How long does your game take to play?<br>
      Roughly 30 seconds to however long a player plays and continues to not-lose for until the game is over.
