      ## Sorting Frenzy<br>
      ### Originality: What is original about your game?<br>
      The sorting component. Having balls fall above the wooden-ramps and having the player swap buckets to catch balls that match that bucket's color is the original component of the game.<br>
      ### Technical Merit: What is interesting about your game technology?<br>
      It uses randomness to spawn balls at different locations, they're bouncy, and physics-based movement of the balls makes it more unique to play each time the level is loaded. Furthermore, the game itself is made with Unity targeting HTML5, which means anyone can play the game given sufficient hardware.<br>
      ### Prototype Postmortem: What did you learn from this prototype? What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
      What I learned from this prototype is that there's a lot that could go wrong if you choose a platform other than windows to develop on (for unity). The easiest part was sitting down and coding the game, but the hardest part was trying to balance the speed of the balls' movement and the reaction time of moving buckets in the game starting at the time the player sends input through a key-press.<br>
      ### Prototype Assets: Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.<br>
      I borrowed assets from the Unity URP template pack and reconfigured the materials on the buckets and reused the props in the sample scene to make the game scene.<br>
      ### Prototype Closest Other Game: Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code, you must say so here.<br>
      <br>
      ### High Concept: A one-sentence summary of your game.<br>
      <br>
      ### Theme: State which of the themes or challenges you used.<br>
    
      ### Mandated Variety: State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.<br>
      #### Input: Keyboard keys A and D for moving the current bucket doing the ball-catching.<br>
      #### Randomness: The positions in which the balls spawn and what color spawns at those spawnpoints.<br>
      #### genre: Classic Arcade (remniscent of Mario-party games)<br>
      #### play style: progressively increasing challenge with an active play-style.<br>
      ### Prototype Goal: What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<br>
      ### The game mechanic that this prototype is evaluating is uncertainty due to simulated physics and randomness (ball colors and their spawnpoints).<br>
      ### Player Experience Goals: What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<br>
      <br>
      ### Gameplay: A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.<br>
      <br>
      ### Strategies: What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<br>
      <br>
      ### Story/Setting/Premise: A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
      <br>
      ### Target Audience: A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<br>
      <br>
      Play Time: How long does your game take to play?<br>
      <br>
